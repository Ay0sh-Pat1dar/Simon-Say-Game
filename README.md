Simon Says is about "How long a sequence can you remember?".
This game improves the memory.
How to play:-
1) One color will blinked in the game, you have to remember it.
2) then you have to click the same color.
3) then another color will be blinked, now you have to remember the sequence of the color.
4) you have to click the sequence of color from starting.

For example:-
Game blinked the color red first, then you have to click the red color, then game blinked the color blue, now you have to click the sequence i.e red->blue, then game blinked the color yellow,
then you have to click red->blue->yellow. If you clicked the wrong sequence then the game will be overed.

Go, and have a try :)
